# StringManipulation
HTS Programming Mission 12

WPF project to try out different technologies

Currently this project runs, but only once. After that for some reason it no longer takes the first 25 characters.


#Description from HTS

This level is about string manipulation.
In this challenge, you will be given a string. Take all the numbers from the string and 
classify them as composite numbers or prime numbers. You should assume all numbers are one digit, 
and neither number 1 nor number 0 counts. Find the sum of every composite number, 
then find the sum of every prime number. Multiply these sums together. 
Then, take the first 25 non-numeric characters of the given string and increment their ASCII value by one 
(for example, # becomes $). Take these 25 characters and concatenate the product to them. This is your answer.
Your answer should look like this: oc{lujxdpb%jvqrt{luruudtx140224
